# School Performance Prediction and Analysis
Major aim for this project is to examine the correlation between students in-year performances and end-of-the-year exam scores at Math. Together with that, we also aim to predict which students are going to underperform at the final exam, which is crucual for school reputation. Under and over performance is defined as if the student gets a score more than state expectations, (s)he is considered overperformed. 

We will use the old data (ie. last year's data) to train an ML model and apply that on new students. 

As of the end of the year, we had all the ALEKS topics and all sort of interim grades. However, since the project aims to predict who will over-under perform at the end of the year, the only numerical grade data we have in hand is the Benchmark test scores. Together with that, we have other sort of information about the students which might be useful.
